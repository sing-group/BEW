	        From BEW's main window, the user can
	        access the operations listed above. Either from the tool bar,
	        which will unlock operations as data becomes available in the clipboard, or from the menu
	        bar.

	    <p>
	        The Clipboard is located on the left side of the menu. In
	        this area the program stores the experiments and
	        any other object that the user might create, enabling a fast and easy access to the information.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	        The central part of the window (Content Panel) is used to visualize the details of the experiment at different levels. 
	        For example, when the user selects the experiment in the clipboard, this panel displays the basic information about the experiment.
