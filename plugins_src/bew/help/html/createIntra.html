    </h3>
    <div id="intro">
        <p>	
            In BEW, the user can create a new Experiment with any number of experimental conditions and including data from several methods of analysis 
            . This process is carried out through multiple
            dialogues orchestrated as a stepwise Wizard.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="firstWindow">
        <h4>First Window - Experiment profile and Constant Conditions</h4>
        <p>
            At start, the user needs to cover
            the basic information of the experiment
            (also called Setup page), shown in
            the image below:
        </p>
        <div class="centered">
            <p>
                <img alt="wizardSetup" src="imgs/wizardSetup.png"/>
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>Here, there are 2 areas of information:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong><dfn>Basic information</dfn></strong>
                <p>The user must fill in 3 mandatory fields: name of the experiment, name of the institution where it was conducted and
                    email of contact. Additional information about the authors, date of execution and associated publication are welcome.
                </p></li>
            <li><strong><dfn>Constant conditions</dfn></strong>
                <p>
                    Constant conditions are conditions that are considered by all the methods of analysis applied.
                </p>
                <p>The user should click on the button 'New
                    Condition', which creates a new condition statment (row in the table).
                    The user should then fill in all new rows (cells in red are uncovered),
                    indicating in the column "Condition name" the name of the experimental condition,
                    in the column "Condition value" the value for this condition, and
                    in the column "Units" the units of measure (if applicable).</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div id="bottomButtons">
        <h4>The bottom options</h4>
        <p> The buttons at the bottom of the main window are explained below:</p>
        <div class="centered">
            <p>
                <img alt="wizardButtons" src="imgs/wizardButtons.png"/>
            </p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><dfn>Previous</dfn></strong>: To display the
                previous page. The content of the window changes to a page
                previously created, if it exists.</li>
            <li><strong><dfn>Next</dfn></strong>: To display the
                following page. The contents of the window changes to a new page
                or to "Finalize"
                button. In order to move to the next page, the current page must be
                properly validated.</li>
            <li><strong><dfn>Finalize</dfn></strong>: To create the
                experiment with all the information inserted. This button is
                available only when the user inserted a minimum set of information and is this is valid.
            </li>
            <li><strong><dfn>Add Method</dfn></strong>: Allows the user
                to insert a page for a method of analysis.</li>
            <li><strong><dfn>Validate</dfn></strong>: Allows the user to
                validate the information provided in the current page. The
                program verifies that the information is correct in terms of structure and metadata. If the
                information is not correct, the program will prompt an error.</li>
            <li><strong><dfn>Delete Page</dfn></strong>: Allows the user
                to delete the current page. This is only possible for method pages, 
                since the initial setup page cannot be deleted without deleting the whole experiment.
                When the user deletes a page, the window changes,
                and displays the previous one.</li>
            <li><strong><dfn>Save As...</dfn></strong>: Saves the state
                of the current experiment to a file, including the data associated to the methods of analysis. All 
                pages must be properly validated. 
            </li>
            <li><strong><dfn>Exit</dfn></strong>: The user can exit the Wizard, having
                completing or not the creation of the experiment. </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="secondWindow">
        <h4>Second Window - Method page</h4>
        <p>
            Once the Setup page is covered, the user can decide to end the creation
            of the experiment without adding any method of analysis for the time being. Otherwise, he should click on "Add Method" button
            to access the method creation window (or method
            page). 
        </p>
        <div class="centered">
            <p>
                <img alt="wizardMethod" src="imgs/wizardMethod.png"/>
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>The window is divided into 3 areas of information:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong><dfn>Method of analysis</dfn></strong>
                <p>
                    The user must select the method from the list provided by BEW whilst it may be manually extended (see <a href="#manageMethods">manage methods section</a>) by the user. 
                    In addition,
                    the user can specify the units of measure that are
                    associated to the analysis (if applicable).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><strong><dfn>Conditions in test</dfn></strong>:
                <p>
                    The user has to indicate the number of conditions tested by the
                    method of analysis and press the "Add" button. This will create the corresponding table. The table should has 
                    as many conditions are created in the table as the previously selected number are created.
                </p>
                <p>Now, the user must specify the name of the conditions. This
                    is done by clicking on the first column of the table.</p>
                <p>Similarly, should indicate the number of values for each
                    condition. Keep in mind that the program manages hierarchical (tree-alike) data structures. 
                </p>
                <p>The user should also specify the units of measure of
                    created condition (wherever applicable).</p>
                <p>Finally, he should click on
                    "Create data table" to create the data table.</p> 
                <div class="centered">
                    <p>
                        <img alt="wizardMethod2" src="imgs/wizardMethod2.png"/>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li><strong><dfn>Data</dfn></strong>:
                <p>
                    After the user specifies the number of conditions and the condition values to be considered, 
                    BEW automatically creates the data table.
                    Then, the user has to
                    fill in the cells in green. BEW provides controlled vocabulary for several commom test conditions,
                    but the user may also create conditions of his own (see vocabulary management section).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user can introduce experimental data by clicking on "New replicate". 
                </p> 
                <div class="centered">
                    <p>
                        <img alt="wizardMethod3" src="imgs/wizardMethod3.png"/>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Once data insertion is completed, the user can check that all the values are correct (in form and structure)
            using the "Validate" button. If succeeded, the user is presented with two
            options: finalize the experiment or
            keep adding pages for methods of analysis.
