            This operation allows the loading of an experiment saved in
            .xls format.

        <div class="centered">

        </div>
        <p>
            First, the user must specify the file to load by pressing the
            button "Import file" and select the location in the hard disk. Once
            selected, the user must proceed by pressing the Ok button.
        </p>
        <p>
            When importing a .xls file, it is necessary to perform a
            series of steps (structuring and validation) to be able to load it with success in
            the program. These steps are explained below:
        </p>
        <p>
            The first window shows the profile data of the
            selected experiment. If the .xls meets the structure required by
            the program, the form fields will be filled in with data, otherwise the user must
            cover them by hand. 
        </p>
        <div class="centered">
            <p>
                <img alt="loadExpSetup" src="imgs/loadExpSetup.png"/>
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Once this Setup page has no errors, the Next button may to be used to import data associated with the analysis methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            The contents are similar to what the user can see when a
            method is edited (operation explained in section<a href="#editMethod"> edit Method</a>). If the file
            structure is correct, the data will be placed in the corresponding form fields and
            tables, as exemplified in the following image.
        </p>
        <div class="centered">
            <p>
                <img alt="loadExpMethod" src="imgs/loadExpMethod.png"/>
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            The data table requires additional curation. It is necessary to indicate which are the
            condition types and the condition values tested by the method. This step is only neccesary if the user doesn't import a xls file with the 
            accepted structured by BEW (see <a href="#xlsStructure">XLS section</a>).
            To do this, the user must select the cells containing the values of a given condition and press the button "1. Name conditions".
            The Conditions table (at the second half of the pane) will show as many rows as
            selected in the table above. The user must indicate the type, # of values and units of measure of each condition.
        </p>
        <div class="centered">
            <p>
                <img alt="loadExpMethod2" src="imgs/loadExpMethod2.png"/>
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            The button "2. Check Conditions" can be used to edit the data table, e.g. to modify
            the values of conditions.
        </p>
        <div class="centered">
            <p>
                <img alt="loadExpMethod3" src="imgs/loadExpMethod3.png"/>
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            The button "3. Delete all Conditions" deletes all the rows
            that are created in the Conditions table. This could be useful if
            the user selects invalid conditions in the Data table.
        </p>
        <div class="centered">
            <p>
                <img alt="loadExpMethod4" src="imgs/loadExpMethod4.png"/>
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Once all these steps are performed, the Validate button should
            be used to verify that everything is correct. If there are no
            errors, the user may click in the Finalize button to finish importing the experiment
            or the Add Method to account for more analytical results.
