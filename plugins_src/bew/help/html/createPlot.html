<title>BEW - Create Plot</title>

		<a id="createPlot" title="createPlot">2.1 Create plot</a>
	</h3>
	<div>
        <p>This option becomes available as soon as there is at least one experiment with analytical results associated (method objects).</p>
        <p>
            To create a plot the user should indicate the experiment and specifically, the method of analysis, to be considered. 
            Then, the user should choose the type of the plot to be constructed.
        </p>
        <div class="centered">
            <p>
                <img alt="addPlot" src="imgs/addPlot.png" class="small"/>
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>There are two types of plots in BEW:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b><i>Bar chart</i></b> -&gt; Plot with bars. The most common type
                in plot data reporting.</li>
            <li><b><i>Point chart</i></b> -&gt; Also known as ScatterPlot. This plot
                requires a condition time in the method.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="centered">
            <p>
                <img alt="addPlot2" src="imgs/addPlot2.png"/>
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            While specifying the data series in the plot, the user is presented with a window divided into 3 areas or
            fields. They are listed below:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><b><i>Method table</i></b>
                <p>
                    The user must select
                    the data to be plotted. Keep in mind that it is mandatory that
                    both data and conditions are selected. The user must select all the condition
                    values belonging to the same parent. Below is, an example of an erroneous selection:
                </p> 
                <div class="centered">
                    <p>
                        <img alt="addPlot3_Invalid" src="imgs/addPlot3_Invalid.png"/>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The figure shows the selection of the copper, *stainless steel* and polyvinyl chloride condition
                    from different parents (*escherichia coli*#2 and *escherichia coli*#4, in organism and *shear force* condition). 
                    The correct selection would be:
                </p> 
                <div class="centered">
                    <p>
                        <img alt="addPlot3_Valid" src="imgs/addPlot3_Valid.png"/>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    When the user selects the data correctly.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><b><i>Plot design</i></b>
                <p>
                    The Plot Design field is filled with
                    the selected data, distributing them between the 2 lists. If the
                    user sees that these are correct, he must press the button
                    Create Plot.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><b><i>Plot preview</i></b>
                <p>
                    Once done, a preview
                    of the chart is created in the field Plot Preview. 
                    If the preview is correct the user may press the
                    Ok button to add it to the method
                    (Note: If the Cancel button is pressed, the plot is not
                    stored).
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Note: For time plots the procedure is the same. The only
            difference is that if the method has several time conditions, the
            user may, once the plot is previewed, move the time columns in
            the method table to change the axes of the chart.
