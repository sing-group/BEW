    <div>
        <p>
            XLS files need to have a correct structure to import them in BEW. 
            The files need two mandatory sheets listed below.
        </p>
        <div class="centered">
            <p>
                <img alt="bewHelp" src="imgs/sheetsExample.png" class="small"/>
            </p>
        </div>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Experiment Setup: In this sheet the user has to put the experiment basic information. The 
                fields are shown in the image below and all of them are self-explanatory.

                <div class="centered">
                    <p>
                        <img alt="bewHelp" src="imgs/setupSheet.png" class="small"/>
                    </p>
                </div>

                If the user doesn't know the BiofOmics ID of the experiment he must leave the cell blank.
            </li>
            <li>
                Constant Conditions: In this sheet the user has to put the experiment constant conditions (if applicable) like in the 
                image below.

                <div class="centered">
                    <p>
                        <img alt="bewHelp" src="imgs/constantSheet.png" class="small"/>
                    </p>
                </div>

                The first column is for condition name, second column is for condition values and third column is for condition units.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Besides the mandatory sheets, the user can create optional sheets for methods of analysis. The user can create from 0 to N methods per file.
            For this example, the user created one method called PNA FISH. The structure of this sheet is as follow:
        </p>
        <div class="centered">
            <p>
                <img alt="bewHelp" src="imgs/methodSheet.png" class="small"/>
            </p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The first row is used to indicate the units of the method.
            </li>
            <li>
                The second row is used to indicate the number of conditions in this method. In the example, the method has 3 conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
                The third row is used to indicate the name of the conditions in the method. 
                As the user indicates that there are 3 conditions in the second row, three different names appear here.
                If the user doesn't know the name of a condition he can leave the cell blank.
            </li>
            <li>
                The following rows are used to indicate the values of the method.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
