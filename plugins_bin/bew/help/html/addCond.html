	    <p>
	        Bew operation is supported by metadata supplied by the biofilms community repository <a href="http://biofomics.org">BiofOmics</a>.
	        Metadata includes the controlled vocabulary on the experimental methods of analysis, and different kinds
	        of experimental conditions (e.g. adhesion materials, culturing media and antimicrobial products).
	    </p>
	    <p>
	        Besides, granting access to these metadata, BEW allows the user to add new metadata.
	        Currently, the user may create 3 types of conditions:
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	        <li><b><i>Numeric</i></b>: These conditions require the introduction of a
	            name for the Condition in its text box as shown in the following image.
	            <p class="centered">
	                <img alt="Numerical" src="imgs/numerical.png"/>
	            </p>
	        </li>
	        <li><b><i>Nominal</i></b>: These conditions imply the specification of a set of values, one by one.
	            <p class="centered">
	                <img alt="Nominal" src="imgs/nominal.png"/>
	            </p>
	        </li>
	        <li><b><i>Metacondition</i></b>: This is a special type of condition that results from the combination of values from pre-existing and individual conditions.
	            For example, the user may create a metacondition specifying a pre-defined medium supplemented with a given substance.
	            <p class="centered">
	                <img alt="Metacondition" src="imgs/introMeta.png"/>
	            </p>
	        </li>
	    </ul>
	    <div>
	        <p>
	            With this operation the user can add a new condition to the
	            program files for use in future creations of experiments. When
	            user click on this operation, the program opens a window like the
	            one shown below:
	        </p>
	        <div class="centered">
	            <p>
	                <img alt="addCond" src="imgs/addCond.png"/>
	            </p>
	        </div>
	        <p>
	            Initially the user has the area Introduces Condition to indicate the name of the new condition and the type. The type
	            of condition can be two fold:
	        </p>
	        <ul>
	            <li><b><i>Numerical</i></b>:
	                <p>
	                    For example the temperature, it can takes from 0 to
	                    infinity.
	                </p> 
	                <div class="centered">
	                    <p>
	                        <img alt="introNumerical" src="imgs/introNumerical.png" class="small"/>
	                    </p>
	                </div>
	            </li>
	            <li><b><i>Nominal</i></b>:
	                <p>For example, a set of antimicrobials.</p> 
	                <div class="centered">
	                    <p>
	                        <img alt="introNominal" src="imgs/introNominal.png"/>
	                    </p>
	                </div>
	            </li>
	        </ul>
	        <p>
	            If the user indicates that the condition is numerical he
	            does not have to do anything else. On the other hand, if the user
	            indicates that the condition is nominal, the program creates
	            another area in the dialogue.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	            Here, the user must indicate the values that have this
	            condition. The user can create an empty nominal condition and
	            include these values at a later stage, the operation of <a href="#addCondValues">Add
	                condition values</a>. The button New Condition
	            value is used to enter the value. Then, the user has to
	            write the value of the condition in the text box.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	            Once the user finishes creating conditions must press the
	            Finish button to accept changes.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	            Note: when using the condition and condition values created
	            from these operations, they are displayed between **. This is
	            because they are condition and condition values that are not
	            validated by a curator.
	        </p>
